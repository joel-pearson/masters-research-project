- Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
- Open 'Anaconda prompt'.
- Change the working directory to 'MSc-research-project' by running the following command:
   - cd ../MSc-research-project
- Create a new virtual environment and install all dependencies for the project by running the following command:
   - conda env create -f venv/environment.yml
- Ensure the virtual environment is active by running:

- Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
- Open the Anaconda Navigator.
- Select the 'environments' tab on the left of the window.
- A tab containg a list of environments should be displayed. (If this is the first time using Anaconda Navigator, 'base (root)' will be the only environment present).
- Select 'import' at the bottom of the list of environments.
- Browse to '../MSc-research-project/venv/environment.yml
- Name your environment and press 'import'.
- In the list of environments, select your newly named environment that has just been created.
